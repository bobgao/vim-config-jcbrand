	    Stephen Riehm's Bracketing macro system for Vim
	    ===============================================

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------

    There are essentially two things you need to do to use these
    macros:
	
	1.  Find out if you can use "Meta" keys - see the meta.keys
	    file for details of how to do this.

	2.  Get vim to read the right version of the macros.

    More explicitly, you can either read the macros into vim
    'as-is' with the :source command, or you can edit your .vimrc and
    add the macro definitions directly there. If you're a system
    admin, you might want to leave the macros in
    /usr/local/share/vim/macros or something similar, and let anyone
    :source them directly from there.

    If you don't want to keep this directory, and you don't want to
    edit your .vimrc, you might like to copy the macros file of your
    choice to ~/.vim.macros or ~/.vim.brackets
