	    Stephen Riehm's Bracketing macro system for Vim
	    ===============================================

(C)opyright: Stephen Riehm 1991 - 1998

This directory contains files which can be combined with your existing
macros, or put in a public directory for all to use.

These macros were originally developed in 1991 for vi by Stephen Riehm.
As vim came into being, the macros were simplified, extended, made
more complex, mapped to Meta keys and lo and behold, were even
documented! (roughly in that order :-)

If you want to check that these files weren't damaged in transit,
you can check them with md5sum:

    md5sum -c Checksums

For further information about the macros, see:

	Readme		please don't bother reading this file again ;-)
	License		hey, I'm really not asking for much!
	Install		installation information
	Checksums	md5 checksums for this directory
	macros.txt	full description in 7-bit ASCII
	macros.html	the same description in HTML
	macros.meta	the macro-set using Meta key mappings
	macros.no-meta	a slightly reduced set of mappings which don't
			use Meta keys. (but still use non-ASCII
			characters for the markers)
	meta.keys	a description of the hoops you might have to
			jump through to get Meta keys working on X11.
	xmodtable	a little script to help those in real trouble.
	Templates/	some examples of using the special markers
			from these macros to prepare code templates
			and forms. Included are examples for man
			pages, html pages, C++ programs, shell scripts
			and perl modules - just to get you started.
			These templates were taken directly from my
			~/etc directory - with copyright messages etc,
			you would be wise to edit them to your tastes
			before using them :-)

These macros are designed to work with vim 5.0 and have been tested on
AIX and HP-UX.

Good luck and happy hacking.
