	    Stephen Riehm's Bracketing macro system for Vim
	    ===============================================

(C)opyleft: Stephen Riehm 1991 - 2000

The directory tree contains macros for implementing Stephen Riehm's
bracketing system in vim. These macros should be useful for anyone who
writes a lot of code or normal text, where brackets and quotes appear
often.

The following directories should have been included in this package:

    INSTALL		installation instructions
    doc/		complete HTML documentation
    macros/		the macro files
    templates/		example template files
    x11/		X11 help for Meta Key problems

For more information, please see the HTML documentation in the doc/
directory.

Good luck and happy hacking.
