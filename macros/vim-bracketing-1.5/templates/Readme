	Stephen Riehm's template files
	==============================

This directory contains a few of the template files which I use on a
day to day basis. They basically help me make sure that I've got all
the "standard" headers and comments etc in the code I write.

Note that between the markers are comments. When you jump to a marker,
any such comment appears on the command line at the bottom of the
screen. I've used this to remind me which macro I should use to
automagically fill out some of the values (ie: the file name in the
#ifdef's of C files.) You can ignore these hints at other macros, as
those macros are not in this distribution.

I have removed the copyright messages etc, but you would be wise to
edit them before using them. Making your own from scratch is also
probably not a bad idea (and not at all difficult)
