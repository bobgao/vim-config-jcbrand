	    Stephen Riehm's bracketing macro system for Vim
	    ===============================================

License:
========

    It's real simple. You can use, share, and distribute these macros
    and associated help files, in any environment, commercial or
    private, for whatever purpose you like. They were written by me,
    for me, if you can make sense of them, you're welcome to use them.

    All I ask is that my name and copyright remains in-tact, as the
    original author of these files. If you make changes and then
    distribute the modified macros, there is nothing to stop you from
    ADDING your name to the files, but please don't DELETE the names
    of those before you. It's only fair that the people who worked on
    the macros should at least be recognisable, should someone actually
    want to know who was sick enough to create this stuff.

    However, I am in now way liable for any damages you may incur by
    using these macros, nor do I guarantee that they will even work on
    your system. They work for me, I've made them publicly available
    because I'm a nice guy :-)

    This license is way too official for a bunch of macros :-)
