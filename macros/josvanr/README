"   This file sources .vim files that contain mappings, settings,      
"   functions and combinations of the three. The mappings available at 
"   vim-startup, are defined in |map.vim|. General settings are defined
"   in |settings.vim|. Use ,s to edit this (see |setup.vim|).
"                                                                      
"   Other .vim files can be sourced at will, to add functionality.
"   Note that some files contain dependencies, so sourcing those files
"   can cause other files to be sourced also. Most included files also
"   define additional mappings.
