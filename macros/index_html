<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Welcome to Zope!</H1>

<P>Congratulations, your Zope is up and running.  To view 
some shameless Zope propaganda, please visit the included 
<a href="<!--#var URL1-->/QuickStart/">QuickStart</a> material.</P>

<P>To visit the management interface, please click on the 
following link.  You will be prompted for the username and password 
you used when you ran the Zope <code>install</code> utility.  If 
you have forgotten, it is stored in the <code>access</code> file in 
the Zope directory.</P>

<P>If that username and password does not work and you are 
integrating it with <em>your</em> web server, then this probably 
means that your web server does not pass authentication information 
to CGI scripts.  The <a href="http://www.zope.org/Support">Support area</a>
on the Zope website has information to help you with this and
other problems.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Visit the <a 
href="<!--#var URL1-->/manage">management screen</a>!</P>
