Installation instructions of Vim FTP Explorer

IMPORTANT NOTE:

This product requires vim with python support compiled in
  If you're in debian:
    apt-get install vim-python

  If you want to know if your vim has python support, start vim and try: 
	:py print "Hello World"
  if you get "Sorry, this command is not implemented" 
  then your vim lacks python support.

   information about your Zope FTP Server:
    - host
    - port
    - username
    - password

3. edit ftpExplorer.vim and set the correct path to ftpExplorer.py
   this setting is under a label that says 
   'BE SURE THE PATH BELOW IS CORRECT'

4. copy ftpExplorer.vim wherever you want on your filesystem.

5. edit your ~/.vimrc and add the following entry:
   source /path/to/your/ftpExplorer.vim
